This makes no difference in stereoisomer count, but to 
eliminate unnecesary output, change line 56 of 

Ligand_GA_Fitness_Function_GOLD_ADME.m 

from:  system("rm -r "+ligand_dir+"/molecule"+molecule_idx+"/*.*);
to:    system("rm -r "+ligand_dir+"/molecule"+molecule_idx+"/*);

The latter deletes files and directories, not just files, and the 
count of files remains the same.  The effect of the change is to 
get rid of unnecesary displayed output.
