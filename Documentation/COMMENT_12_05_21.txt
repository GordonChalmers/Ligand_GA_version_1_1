ADME penalty function now included as a call from the 
  fitness function Ligand_GA_Fitness_Function_GOLD_ADME.m 
  
ADME_penalty.m script added 

Ligand_GA_Crossover_Function now symmetrized to include 
  left-right and right-left chromosome parenting.  
  
set_max, a global variable, is added to limit the number of 
  submitted GOLD jobs to a CPU pool to avoid overloading 
  available hard RAM.  set_max=1 is now the default, with 
  1 molecule and its stereoisomers (ranging from 1 to 512, any 
  number from max_stereosiomers).
  
  
Version 2.0 available next and is being used now.  This version uses a 
  Multi-Objective function, and Pareto front, to optimize/create small 
  molecules in a multi-protein (enzyme) system.  i.e., high interaction to 
  target protein(s) and low interaction to other protein(s), with different 
  weights. The altered Paxlovid small molecules are being used in modification 
  to create binders to the SARS-Cov-2 main protease and CYP 3A4 liver enzyme 
  in effect to eliminate the Ritonavir molecule which is used in the Pfizer 
  drug to slow the metabolism in the liver enzymes.  This is acheived by 
  modifying Paxlovid in a way that it interacts strongly with the binding 
  site of 3CL Mpro of SARS-Cov-2 and minimal interaction with the enzyme CYP 3A4.  
  (Any number of proteins can now be used in the multi-protein ligand binding 
  system, and version 2 to be released.)
